Loop : Loops are used in programming to repeatedly run a block of code.

different type of loop in javascript:
1. for  Loop: We use for loop to run a piece of code until the set condition turns false.

Syntax : 
for(initial expression; condition ; update expression){
    //for loop body
}

Example":
for(let i=1;i<5;i++){
    console.log(i)
}
//output
/* 1
2
3
4*/

2. While loop: This loop keeps on running as long as the condition is true.

Syntax:
while(condition){
    //body of the loop
}
Example:
let i=0; n=5;
while(i<n){
    console.log(i);
    i++
}

3. do while loop: this loop similar to while loop but one differnce on it that first iteration 
run always and later iteration run after codition evaluates to true.

Syntax:
do{
    //  body of the loop
}while(condition);

Example:
let i=n;
do{
    console.log(i);
    i--;
}while(i<n && i>0)
